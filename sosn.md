There are two categories of people: People who put people into two categories, and people who don’t. In this exciting episode of “Something Old, Something New” Buck and Anna will show you how to categorize and classify things using math and Machine Learning. As always, be ready to learn and have fun!

(Oh, and we’ll explain that title. Promise.)

Join Buck and Anna as they regress. I mean, explain Regression. Anyway, you'll learn one of the most widely used tools in Statistics and Data Science, and how the math works for its predictions. There's spreadheets, code, Notebooks and more in this thrill-packed episode, you won't want to miss it!

Our hero Buck goes on a trip (virtually though, since there's a thing) to the data jungle to detangle the tangled. He also notices that your data is a bit...chunky, and shows you how to go low-calorie with your algorithms. Anna shows up to save the day with something really deep. Deep Learning, that is.

In this exciting episode, Buck and Anna introduce the show, and explain the deep and dark meaning behind the show's intriguing title. You'll learn the maths behind Data Science and Machine Learning, why you might want to learn more about them, and then Anna explains a dead-simple way to tell if she wants more coffee.

Probably.
